# IT3030 - Deep Learning

Projects done in the course IT3030 - Deep Learning at NTNU.

* Project 1 contains a custom implementation of backpropagation in conjunctin with a PyTorch-like API.
* Project 2 concerns using traditional autoencoders for unsupervised learning & classification on datasets such as CIFAR and Fashion-MNIST.
* Project 3 concerns variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks on 3-channel (stacked) MNIST images. I also implemented the VEEGAN-algorithm [1].
